Project README
Overview
This project involves detailed data analysis and visualization of space missions and budget allocations of various space agencies using Jupyter Notebook. The analysis includes a series of animated bar charts and pie charts, providing an interactive and dynamic view of the data.

Visualization in Jupyter Notebook
For the best possible data visualization experience, this project leverages the capabilities of Jupyter Notebook, an ideal platform for interactive data visualization and analysis. Jupyter Notebook allows for the execution of live code, and integration of rich text elements and visualizations in a single document.

Animated Visualizations
The project includes animated bar charts and pie charts that dynamically illustrate changes over time and distributions of data in an interactive format. These visualizations are created using libraries such as Plotly, which provides advanced graphical techniques and animation capabilities.

GitHub Viewing Limitations
It is important to note that GitHub's interface does not display the animations embedded in the Jupyter Notebooks. Static images or non-interactive charts may appear in place of the intended animations when viewed directly on GitHub.

Running the Notebooks
To fully experience the animated visualizations and interactive elements:

Download the Repository: Clone or download the ZIP file of the GitHub repository to your local machine.
Open Jupyter Notebook: Navigate to the downloaded repository folder and launch Jupyter Notebook. You can do this by opening your command line or terminal, navigating to the project directory, and running the command jupyter notebook.
Run the Notebooks: Open the .ipynb notebook files within Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to activate the animations and interact with the visualizations.
Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed to run the Jupyter Notebooks:

Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Necessary Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. These can be installed via pip (pip install library-name) or conda, depending on your Python environment setup.
Conclusion
This project's use of Jupyter Notebook enhances the analytical capabilities by allowing comprehensive data manipulation and rendering detailed, interactive visualizations for a deeper understanding of the data. For the best user experience, please follow the instructions above to view the animated charts directly within a local Jupyter Notebook environment.
