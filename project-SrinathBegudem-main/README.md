# Project Name

**Detailed guidelines are posted on DEN under the `project` folder.**

## 1. Key Points 
* Please refrain from including personal identifiers (name, USC ID, username) in file names
* Ensure all external libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`
* For large datasets, provide a Google Drive link
* Do not delete `__init__.py` files
* Remove this section before submitting the final version

## 2. Objective
* Briefly describe project goals within 250 characters

## 3. Install Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Custom Information
* Include project-specific instructions, such as running scripts with appropriate arguments
* Feel free to create multiple sections and subsections in the README.md to improve readability of the repo
* Demonstrations of importing custom-built functions and modules can be found in `src/get_data.py` and `src/utils/helper.py`.

## 5. Raw and Processed Data Sizes
Github limits files to 100 MiB and frowns upon anything bigger than 50MiB. 
Since these are static files, you may just put a link to a Google Drive, Dropbox, or similar folder in your README file. 
Put some sample data just for us to test your code.

## Acknowledgements
* Provide acknowledgments to websites if necessary.
